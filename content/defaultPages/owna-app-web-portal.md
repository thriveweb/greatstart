# OWNA Childcare Management Software: Enhancing Communication with Parents

We believe that communication with parents is essential to providing the best possible care for their children. That’s why we use OWNA Childcare Management Software, a comprehensive platform that allows us to stay connected with parents and keep them up-to-date with their child’s progress. With the OWNA app, parents can log in and access a range of information, including centre events, child attendance and details, dietary information, medication details, invoices & transactions, and reports on their child’s development. We’re excited to be using this innovative software to enhance our communication with parents and provide them with greater peace of mind.

Parents can download the app from the Apple Store or the Google Play Store.
