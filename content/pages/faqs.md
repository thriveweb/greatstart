          We do not have a minimum number of days to attend. But we do recommend
          a minimum two-day enrolment per child. Attending for two days or more
          per week allows your child to settle in quickly, build strong
          relationships with other children and Educators and enables them to
          get the most benefit from our curriculum and programs.

          embrace the Victorian and National Early Years Learning Frameworks.

          Here are some guidelines that will help your child dress:


          * Clothing that is comfortable and provides protection from the sun. 
          Shirts should have sleeves and shoes should protect feet and be easy
          for the child to take on and off. Children are not to wear thongs. All
          clothing and shoes should be clearly labelled with your child’s name.

          safety issues.

          * Children must have a sun-safe hat to participate in outdoor
          activities.  The hat must have a wide brim to protect ears and neck. 
          Please do not bring baseball caps as they are not sun-safe. Please
          refer to our Sun Safety Policy for more information.

          * Please apply SPF 30+ sunscreen to your child before they arrive at
          the centre.  Educators and children will reapply sunscreen as needed
          throughout the day.

          We offer spring / summer and autumn / winter menus both of which are

          that children are provided with the recommended daily intake of each
          food group. Breakfast, Morning Tea, Lunch and Afternoon Tea are
          provided. Dietary, cultural and medical needs are also catered for at

          Rest time is included in the daily program to allow children to
          recuperate from the morning’s activities. The rest period allows
          children to gather their thoughts and revive for the remainder of the
          day. Children who do not sleep are encouraged to rest their bodies
          quietly or are provided with quiet activities such as books and
          puzzles.

          Celebrating birthdays is great fun and can be an important social
          activity for children. If you would like to bring a cake for your
          child’s birthday this is allowed. However, due to health regulations
          we ask that you supply a purchased cake in its correct packaging with
          a detailed ingredients list remembering not to bring anything with
          nuts due to potential allergies.

          Every child develops at a different pace, and when you and your Centre
          Director feel your child is ready, your child will move to a new
          classroom and new experiences. The move between classrooms is called
          transitioning. Some children need time to transition and this is
          completely normal. During the transition time, your child will visit
          the new room and start to become familiar with other educators and
          their new environments.

          The Centre follows meticulous cleaning procedures to ensure a
          sanitary, hygienic and organised environment for all children and
          educators. To maintain our high levels of cleanliness in both indoor
          and outdoor settings, educators follow cleaning schedules throughout
          the day. Educators model and encourage children to practice good
          personal hygiene by washing their hands following; play, using the
          toilet, blowing their nose, before eating and covering their mouths
          when coughing or sneezing. Regular hand washing is a systematic
          practice throughout our centre and considered an utmost priority.
